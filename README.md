# VGC smoother for GRACE  

#### Description
Variable-scale non-isotropic Gaussian-variant convolution (VGC) smoother is a new smoother designed for Gravity  Recovery  and  Climate  Experiment (GRACE) time-variable gravity fields based on Gaussian convolution on sphere.
Its smoothing scale is appropriately given according to the magnitude of the noise in space, and the difference of noise in different directions is considered.
